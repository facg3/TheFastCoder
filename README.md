### How did it Start:

We started with the User Stories which tells us what this page has to contain and we starting with putting things together based on these user Stories to Come Up with the following Sketches:

### Our Work:

It was to divide the work between Us to achieve the page that Satisfy the User Stories So we have Shown the Sketches the Work Plan Goes as Follow :

    Yasmin : Built the Header Section, Newsletter Section and the Footer.
    Walaa  : Built the team part and the contact section.
    Yahya  : Built the About area.

So one of us created the repository ,and every one created a branch to do his/her part after doing our tasks we merged the branches where we faced a lot of issues of conflicting. Some of the issues that We faced:

    a lot of conflicts happened in the style sheet because we all work on the same file targeting the elements was also wrong,which affected others work.

    We did not Know that We have to pull to update our copy of the project.
    Issues using github We lost files!!.
